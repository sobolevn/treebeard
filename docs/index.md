# ðŸŒ² Welcome to Treebeard

Treebeard is a library which automates and tests data science projects, natively supporting Jupyter Notebooks.

Treebeard allows you to do the following without bash scripts:

- Setup continuous integration for your Github repo, to test notebooks on each push
- Automatically build a project container image
- Fetch outputs from each cloud run using versioned URLs
- See outputs over time in an admin page

The goal is to allow data scientists to set up **continuous integration** with minimal changes to their project.

We recommend quickly getting a project hosted on Github running with the [Github App](https://github.com/marketplace/treebeard-build). Once the Github App is watching your repository, it will build any notebooks in the project (or as specified in `treebeard.yaml`) when a commit is made.

The following sections describe setup for working from the CLI.

## Configuration

Treebeard expects project dependencies to be listed in a `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, or `environment.yml`. The `treebeard` pip package should also be added, once installed for local testing.

Treebeard then expects a `treebeard.yaml` file in the same directory:

```yaml
# example treebeard.yaml
notebooks:
  - run.ipynb
ignore:
  - venv
output_dirs:
  - output
  - plots
secrets:
  - secrets.json
```

Runs can be triggered with `treebeard run`.

We host back-end infrastructure for running your notebook in the cloud, and serving output data.

## Install Treebeard

Treebeard is available via pip. Please note only Python 3.6 or higher is supported.

```bash
âžœ pip --version
pip 20.0.2 from /Users/.../python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
```

```bash
âžœ pip install treebeard
```

## Get started

Before running against remote services, create an account at https://treebeard.io/signin and follow the instructions for configuring the CLI.

```bash
âžœ git clone https://github.com/treebeardtech/treebeard.git
```

### Running your first example

```bash
âžœ cd treebeard/examples/hello_treebeard
âžœ jupyter notebook
...

âžœ treebeard run --daily

# get the latest outputs

# what's my API key?
âžœ cat ~/.treebeard
[credentials]
treebeard_email = laurence@treebeard.io
treebeard_project_id = xxxxxx
treebeard_api_key = xxxxxxxxx

âžœ curl -o my_data.json \
https://api.treebeard.io/b44c784b10/treebeard_example_2/cli/output/my_data.json?api_key=xxxxxxxxxx
{"mydata": "goes_here"}
```

The entry example shows the basic capabilities of the cloud build service.  
The notebook uses some cloud credentials to call an API, saves an image to an output directory, and calls a separate python script.

We recommend working in a python virtual environment. Ensure your python (3.6 or higher) environment has jupyter and treebeard installed, and then start jupyter in the project directory:
`jupyter notebook`

Open `main.ipynb` and check out the examples. When you're ready, return to the command line and instruct treebeard to build the project on the cloud with:
`treebeard run`

### Examples

There are several example projects in the `examples` folder.

The `reddit_tracker` example shows a notebook that calls the Reddit API using saved credentials, extracts the most commonly mentioned names from recent submissions and saves charts showing those common names. This is then run daily, and the images can then be served through a browser extension. [This blog]("https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-track-sentiment-on-reddit-with-python-and-a-chrome-extension-a623d63e3a1d?gi=90de4fb3934a") goes into more detail.
